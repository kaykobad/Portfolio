## Overview
One of my clients from Greece asked me if I could help him build an app that works as a tourist guide to the visitors of Kos in Greece. He said, "The app needs to be on both platforms(Android & iOS) and should deliver the best experience to the tourists."

The challenge was to build a tourist app on both Android and iOS to deliver the best experience to its users. The app should not only be fast and smooth, but it should also be loaded with lots of cool features along with real-time data reload, push notifications, events, user analytics, location tracking, and much more!

I took this awesome opportunity to build my very first international tourist guide app. After working for four months, finally, the app got published on both Play Store & App Store. I built Kalimera with Flutter as a cross-platform mobile framework and Firebase as the backend. Flutter gives the native performance and experience, while Firebase provides us with real-time database, user monitoring, push notification, analytics, and other services.

> Kalimera app connects Kos’ visitors with the local experience they deserve. We aim to offer you the best experience possible and the most beautiful memories to take back home from the most popular spots to the best-hidden gems.
