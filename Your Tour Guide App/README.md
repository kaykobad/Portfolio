## Overview
One of my clients asked me if I could help him build an app that works as a tourist guide to the visitors of the most beautiful island in the world. He said, "The app needs to be on both platforms(Android & iOS) and should deliver the best experience to the tourists."

The challenge was to build a tourist app on both Android and iOS to deliver the best experience to its users. The app should not only be fast and smooth, but it should also be loaded with lots of cool features along with real-time data reload, push notifications, events, user analytics, location tracking, and much more!

I took this awesome opportunity to build my very first international tourist guide app. After working for four months, finally, the app got published on both Play Store & App Store. I built this app with Flutter as a cross-platform mobile framework and Firebase as the backend. Flutter gives the native performance and experience, while Firebase provides us with real-time database, user monitoring, push notification, analytics, and other services.
